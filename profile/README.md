## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


# TLDR
We are an AI startup that develops tools to personalize app/websites for users instantly

## Some more detail ... 
All apps using Eula authentication publish their user data to the shared data pools hosted within our customer data platform. We use these shared data pools to train personalization models, which are then sent back to our client apps.
Users of an app then receive a personalized experience immediately after login, which cuts down onboarding time for the user. For every app a user signs up on with Eula, their data comes preloaded and accumulates as they use the apps. 

For developers, this would be as simple as using the Eula API and GUI. Rather than doing in-house data collection and pipeline development, clients can use Eulaâ€™s shared data pools to increase user retention.

Other features we are considering include a UI and iOS app for users to further tailor their data and preferences.
